    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p id="hello">Dear Mom,

I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude and love for you. Throughout my life, you’ve been my rock, my confidante, and my guiding light. Your unwavering support, sacrifices, and boundless affection have shaped me into the person I am today.

From the late nights when you comforted me to the delicious meals you prepared, every act of love has left an indelible mark on my heart. Your wisdom, patience, and resilience inspire me daily. You’ve taught me the true meaning of compassion, kindness, and strength.

Mom, your laughter fills our home with warmth, and your hugs provide solace even on the toughest days. Your love is a constant presence, and I am forever grateful for it.

On this special day, I want to celebrate you—the extraordinary woman who wears many hats: mother, friend, mentor, and confidante. May your heart always be filled with joy, and may you know how deeply cherished you are.

Thank you for being my guiding star, my safe haven, and my biggest cheerleader. I love you more than words can express.

Happy Mother’s Day!

With all my love,

[Zack].</p>
